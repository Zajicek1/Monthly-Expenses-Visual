# Monthly-Expenses-Visual

This program/script takes a .csv file and displays the monthly expenses to the user in a visual representation. In order to run the program, the file path and the file must all be included. If mistakes in this process are apparent, errors will be thrown.

For future work, adjustments will be added to show:
    the average spending of the month
    the category which is the most expensive
    the total spending of the month
    
Styling the code and organization can be much better, and those issues will be addressed when working forwards.
