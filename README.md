# Monthly-Expenses-Visual

This program/script takes a .csv file and displays the monthly expenses to the user in a visual representation. In order to run the program, the file path and the file must all be included. If mistakes in this process are apparent, errors will be thrown.

## TO-DO:
***
For future work, adjustments will be added to show:
   * The average spending of the month
   * The category which is the most expensive
   * The total spending of the month
    
Styling the code and organization can be much better, and those issues will be addressed when working forwards.
